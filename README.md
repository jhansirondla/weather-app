## Description
A simple full-stack weather application that allows users to:
- Search weather by city using OpenWeatherMap API
- Save the results locally using a Flask backend and SQLite database
- View, update, and delete saved entries
- View a description of PM Accelerator through an info button

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Python (Flask, SQLite)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- External API: OpenWeatherMap

- To run the Weather App, first open a terminal, go to the backend folder, install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt, and start the server with python app.py (this runs on http://127.0.0.1:5001). Then, open the frontend/index.html file in your browser to use the app. You can search for weather by city, view and manage saved entries, and access information about PM Accelerator using the info button.
